# Dijkstra Algorithm

![](../../.gitbook/assets/dijkastra1.png)

The start and destination nodes, along with many intermediate nodes like B,C,D are considered for path planning. Going along a path from one node to other carries a cost along with it. The algorithm aims to minimise this cost while going from Start to End.

The computational complexity for this algorithm increases quadratically with the number of nodes.
