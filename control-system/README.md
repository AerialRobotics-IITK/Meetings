# Control System

We have implemented two type of controllers for our MAVs:

* Model Free controller
  * Proportional Integrator Derivative (PID) controller :&#x20;

{% content-ref url="pid-controller/" %}
[pid-controller](pid-controller/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* Model Based controller
  * Model Predictive Controller (MPC)

{% content-ref url="model-predictive-control/" %}
[model-predictive-control](model-predictive-control/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
