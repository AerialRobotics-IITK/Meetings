# Datasets

## Vision Based Systems

### The KITTI Vision Benchmark Suite

* KITTI's tasks of interest are: stereo, optical flow, visual odometry, 3D object detection and 3D tracking. For this purpose, They equipped a standard station wagon with two high-resolution color and grayscale video cameras. Accurate ground truth is provided by a Velodyne laser scanner and a GPS localization system.
