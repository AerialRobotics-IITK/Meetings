# publish static transforms

### publish-static-transformations

static\_transform\_publisher x y z yaw pitch roll frame\_id child\_frame\_id period\_in\_ms

> Publish a static coordinate transform to tf using an x/y/z offset in meters and yaw/pitch/roll in radians. \(yaw is rotation about Z, pitch is rotation about Y, and roll is rotation about X\). The period, in milliseconds, specifies how often to send a transform. 100ms \(10hz\) is a good value.

static\_transform\_publisher x y z qx qy qz qw frame\_id child\_frame\_id period\_in\_ms

> Publish a static coordinate transform to tf using an x/y/z offset in meters and quaternion. The period, in milliseconds, specifies how often to send a transform. 100ms \(10hz\) is a good value.

static\_transform\_publisher is designed both as a command-line tool for manual use, as well as for use within roslaunch files for setting static transforms. For example:
