# Installing Ubuntu
  System requirements (recommended):
1.	2 GHz dual-core processor
2.	4GB memory
3.	25GB available disk space for storage (less if installing the minimal version)
4. 	DVD drive or USB port
5. 	At least a 4GB USB drive. Make sure to backup any existing data on the USB drive because any data on it will get ERASED in the process.
#### Note:	
You might need to restart the computer a few times in the process and press F12 repeatedly while you do that (so as to get to the boot menu, for instance). This can be boring and tiresome so do things carefully step by step. Hehe.
•	Here is a tutorial which will help: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-ubuntu-20-04
•	Go through the overview first.


# Overview

## I. Download the .iso file

> The latest stable version of Ubuntu that can support all the software we use is 20.04.
Steps:
1.	Go the ubuntu official website.
2.	Ubuntu desktop (for 20.04) will be there under ‘download’.
3.	Save the file somewhere on your device.


Download the required Ubuntu disk image file from here:

{% hint style="info" %}
The file is named **ubuntu-16.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso**.
{% endhint %}

## II. Load it onto a BOOTABLE USB drive
Steps: 
1.	For this, you’ll require this thing called ‘Rufus’.

2.	Download it. Run the file.
3.	Plug-in the USB. There will be a pop-up window. That’s Rufus.
4.	Select the ISO file under ‘Boot Selection’. Hit start.




## III.	Boot up Ubuntu from the USB.

Steps:
1.	Turn your system off. Then insert the USB.
2.	Then turn it on again. Now there are two possible scenarios. Either the computer boots up the USB on its own or you’ll have to do it manually using Boot Menu or BIOS.
3.	For Manual booting, do the F12-repeat thing described above.
4.	Once it’s done, use the up/down arrows to select Ubuntu.


## IV.	Run and install
This involves numerous steps, basically making some ‘space’ for Ubuntu on your hard drive (partitioning) and then creating your account, customising etc. Read the tutorial for details about this.
